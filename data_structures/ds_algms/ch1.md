# 1. PYTHON PRIMER


## 1.1 Python Overview:
### 1.1.1 Python Interpreter:
Python is formally an integrated language.
Using "-i" flag we can execute a script and then enter interactive mode (e.g., python -i demo.py)

### 1.1.2 Preview of a Python Program
Python's syntax relies heavily on the use of whitespace.
Individual statements are typically concluded with a newline character, although a command can extend to another line, either with a concluding backslash character (\).

## 1.2 Objects in Python
Python is an object-oriented language and classes form the basis for all data types.

### 1.2.1 Identifiers, Objects, and the Assignment Statement
Identifiers (Reseved Words):
False       as      continue     else    from    in       not     return  yield
None        assert  def          except  global  is       or      try
Ture        break   del          finally if      lambda   pass    while
and         classes elif         for     import  nonlocal raise   with

### 1.2.2 Creating and Using Objects

### 1.2.3 Built-In Classes
A class is immutable if each object of that class has a fixed value upon instantiation that cannot subsequently be changed.
