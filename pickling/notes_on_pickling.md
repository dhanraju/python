- Pickle module is used for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
- Any object in python can be pickled; so that it can be saved on disk. It serializes the object first and then writing it to file.
- Pickling is a way to convert a python object (list, dict, etc.) into a character stream. The idea is that this character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object in another python script.
