1. A matrix is an arrangement of real or complex numbers into rows and columns so that all the rows (columns) contain equal number of elements.
2. If a matrix consists of 'm' rows and 'n' columns, then it is said to be of order mXn.
3. Square matrix: A matrix of order nXn
4. Null matrix: A matrix (aij)mxn, if aij = 0 for all i and j
5. Diagonal matrix: A matrix (aij)nxn, if aij = 0 for all i != j.
6. Scalar matrix: A matrix (aij)nxn, if aij = 0 for all i != j and aij = k (constant) for i = j.
7. Unit (Identity) matrix: A matrix (aij)nxn, if aij = 1, when i = j and
								 				 aij = 0, when i != j
8. Singular Matrix: A matrix (aij)nxn, if detA = 0
9. Non-Singular Matrix: A matrix (aij)nxn, if detA != 0


Matrix Operations:
------------------
1. Addition: If A = (aij)mxn, B = (bij)mxn, then A + B = (aij + bij)mxn
2. Multiplicaion: If A = (aij)mxn, B = (bij)nxp, then AB = (Sigma K=1ton (aik x bkj))mxp
3. Transpose: If A = (aij)mxn, then (A)T = (aji)nxm


Theorems:
---------
1. If A is a matrix of order mxn, then (AI)n = (I)m(A) = A(AI = IA = A)
2. If AB = CA = I, then B = C
3. (KA)T = K(A)T, (A + B)T = AT + BT, (AB)T = (B)T x (A)T
4. A(B + C) = AB + AC, (A + B)C = AC + BC
5. If AB = 0, where A and B are non-zero square matrices, then both A and B are singular.
6. If A is any square matrix, then A x adjA = adjA x A = detA x I
7. If A is any square matrix and there exists a matrix B such that AB = BA = I, then B is called the inverse of A and denoted by A(-1).
8. A x (A)-1 = (A)-1 x A = I.
9. If A is non-singular, then (A)-1 = adjA/detA or adjA = A x (A)-1
